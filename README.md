# WeatherApp
Simple js app for getting and displaying weather data from https://openweathermap.org/current#geocoding.
To make it running, You need to create account on openweathermap, to get unique API key then, you can paste it to a new file (APIKEY.js) with const string API_KEY.
Sometimes it takes a while to establish newly created key, so You might be getting 401 error for a few minutes, then it should work.
